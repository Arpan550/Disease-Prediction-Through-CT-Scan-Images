# MediPred 
# Disease Prediction Through CT Scan Android App
## TechStack: Java, XML, Firebase, Botpress, Tensorflow

MediPred is an Android application designed for real-time disease prediction using CT scans. It leverages advanced machine learning techniques and integrates various tools for a comprehensive user experience. This project includes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for disease prediction, interactive chatbot support, secure user authentication, and more.

## Features

- **Real-Time CT Scan Disease Prediction**: Developed a CNN model and explored various transfer learning techniques. Integrated the TensorFlow Lite model to enable real-time disease prediction from CT scan images.
  
- **Interactive Chatbot**: Implemented Botpress for interactive chatbot support, providing users with instant assistance and information.

- **Secure User Authentication**: Utilized Firebase for secure user authentication, ensuring a safe and personalized experience.

- **History Tracking and Report Generation**: Enabled history tracking and profile-based report generation using Firebase Firestore, allowing users to keep track of their CT scan results and generate reports based on their profiles.

- **MVVM Design Pattern**: Adopted the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern for a clean, scalable, and maintainable code architecture.
